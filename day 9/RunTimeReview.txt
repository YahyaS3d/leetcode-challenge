for subsequence problem here is time complexity checkout: 
The first loop that records the last occurrence index of each character takes O(N) time as it iterates through the entire string once.

The second loop that processes each character in the string also takes O(N) time in total. In the worst case, it might iterate through the string twice, but the total number of iterations is still linearly proportional to the length of the input string.

The final StringBuilder loop, which builds the result string, iterates through the characters in the stack, which is at most 26 (the lowercase English alphabet), so it has a constant time complexity.

Therefore, the overall time complexity of the code remains O(N), where N is the length of the input string s.

The memory usage of the provided code is as follows:

int[] lastOccurrence: This integer array has a constant size of 26, as it stores the last occurrence index for each of the 26 lowercase English letters. So, its memory usage is O(26), which can be considered a constant factor and is typically negligible.

boolean[] used: This boolean array also has a constant size of 26, as it is used to keep track of whether each letter has been used or not. Like lastOccurrence, its memory usage is O(26), which is a constant factor.

Stack<Character> stack: The size of the stack can vary depending on the input string, but it can never exceed 26 (the number of lowercase English letters). Therefore, the memory usage of the stack is O(26), which is again a constant factor.

StringBuilder result: The size of this StringBuilder depends on the number of characters in the stack, which can be at most 26. So, the memory usage of result is proportional to the size of the stack, O(26) in the worst case.

In summary, the memory usage of the provided code is dominated by constant factors. It uses a small amount of memory for fixed-size arrays and data structures, so the overall memory complexity can be considered O(1), meaning it doesn't grow with the size of the input string.
