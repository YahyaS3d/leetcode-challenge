Given a string s, find the longest palindromic subsequence's length in s.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "bbbab"
Output: 4
Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".
Example 2:

Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: 2
Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bb".
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 1000
s consists only of lowercase English letters.


==TC: time complexty== 

The time complexity of the provided dynamic programming solution is O(n^2)
where 'n' is the length of the input string 's'.
This is because we have a nested loop that goes through all possible pairs of indices in the string
the nested loop runs in linear time for each pair.

==optimize space usage==
using a 1D array instead of a 2D array for dynamic programming. Here's an updated Python solution with reduced space complexity
(check commits to view the difference)

updated solution maintains the same time complexity of O(n^2) but reduces the space complexity to O(n).
It uses the same dynamic programming logic but iterates through the string in reverse order
making use of a single 1D array 'dp' to store the lengths of the longest palindromic subsequences.
