The time and space complexities- 

**Time Complexity**:
1. The loop that processes the `leftChild` and `rightChild` arrays runs in O(n), where n is the number of nodes.

2. The depth-first search (DFS) traversal, which checks for cycles and visits all nodes, has a time complexity of O(n) because in the worst case, it may visit all nodes once.

3. The counting of visited nodes in the `countNodes` function also has a time complexity of O(n).

Therefore, the overall time complexity of the code is O(n).

**Space Complexity**:
1. The primary data structures that consume memory are the `visited` array, which keeps track of visited nodes, and the `parentCount` array, which stores the count of parents for each node. Both of these arrays have a space complexity of O(n) because they have one element per node.

2. The recursion stack used for the DFS traversal also consumes space. In the worst case, where the tree is a skewed tree, the recursion stack can reach a depth of n, which results in an additional O(n) space.

Therefore, the overall space complexity of the code is O(n).

In summary, the code has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n), which makes it efficient for processing binary trees with a reasonable number of nodes.
